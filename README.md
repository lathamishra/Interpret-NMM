# Interpret-NMM
New Media Measure (NMMTM) is a syndicated survey designed to monitor the impact of new and emerging technology on the future of media and entertainment. NMMTM helps brands and agencies visualize data and interpret it in a way that ensures they make meaningful connections with consumers based on where they’re going – not where they’ve been.
